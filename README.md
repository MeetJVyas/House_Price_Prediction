# House_Price_Prediction
A machine learning project on house price prediction using Linear regression, while tuning for accuracy using Ridge regression and Lasso regression.
Project Description:

In this particular project, I am using a dataset that contains information like, Address, Rooms, Type, Price, Seller etc and using that to predict the price of a given house.
However, before making prediction, I'm pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
